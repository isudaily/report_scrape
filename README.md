# report_scrape

This project is used to take a Google Analytics report and scrape the web to retrieve Author and Story Title

This probably only works with IowaStateDaily.com, so I can't imagine this is useful to anyone. This could still be modified a little bit to be used with any news organization, especially a studnet newspaper.
